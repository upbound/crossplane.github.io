# Configure Your Cloud Provider Account

In order for Crossplane to be able to manage resources in a specific cloud
provider, you will need to create an account for Crossplane to use. Use the
links below for cloud-specific instructions to create an account that can be
used throughout the guides:

* [Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Account]
* [Microsoft Azure Service Principal]
* [Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM User]

Once you have configured your cloud provider account, you can get started
provisioning resources!

<!-- Named Links -->

[Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Service Account]: ../cloud-providers/gcp/gcp-provider.md
[Microsoft Azure Service Principal]: ../cloud-providers/azure/azure-provider.md
[Amazon Web Services (AWS) IAM User]: ../cloud-providers/aws/aws-provider.md
